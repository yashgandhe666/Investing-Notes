# Stock Course Notes


## Types of Orders:
- **Market Order**: Buy/sell immediately
- **Limit Order**: Buy/sell at a limit price or better

**Shares Outstanding**: Amount of total shares issued.

**Float**: Amount of shares currently in the market.

**Bid**: (or bid price) Is the highest price that a buyer/bidder is willing to pay for a product = Best Price you can buy at.

**Ask**: (or ask price or offer) Is the lowest price that a seller is willing to receive for a product = Best price you can sell at.

**Spread:** Difference between Ask Price and Bid Price.

**Level 2**: 
- Order Book (entires consist of Buy/Sell orders)
- If a buyer offers more for the same stock than some other buyer, they will be put higher on the priority list. Vice versa for a seller.
  
**Level 1**: Best Ask/ Best Bid.

**Time of Sales**: Displays every single execution that happens on the market. The executions are displayed real time and include information like: time, direction, quantity traded and exchange traded on.

**Going Long**: Buying a stock and selling it back at a higher price.

**Going Short**: 
- Borrowing a stock that you do not own. Selling it. And if the price drops, buying it back at he lower price, giving back the stock to it’s original owner and keeping the difference of price (which is your profit). 
- Shorting is actually risky, because you have a chance of the stock not actually going down, and going to infinite, but the return is finite. 

**Being Flat**: Having no position in a particular stock. Sometimes it is good to not trade.





## Miscellaneous Points:

- When a big player of a company wants to unload shares, he'll wait for the company to announce some good news because that is it the time when a lot of people will be placing orders, thus the only time when his order will go through. Thus, it might so happen that despite the company announcing good news, the share price may go down. Thus, it's helpful to know what the inistitutional ownership of that share is (for example, how many mutual funds, hedge funds, etc. own that share)
- Don't sell at the support line or resistance line. Buy the stock above the support line and sell it below the resistance line. This ensures that you are ahead of the general market.
- ![Evening/ Morning DojiStar](res/1.jpg) Here, after the stock goes down, and the candlestick is a Doji, and then it goes up, this is a trend reversal, because at the Doji there was indecision and then the stock started moving up.
- ![Bearish/Bullish Harami](res/2.jpg) In Bearish Harami, there is trend reversal.
  - Bearish: Market is going down
  - Bullish: Market is going up
-  ![Stronger](res/3.jpg) This pattern is stronger indicator than a Doji because here, there isn't an indecision. Here in the above figure, at the end of the day, we have a clear indicator that sellers have started to win because of the same opening and closing price.
